ntroduction

I study Applied Artificial Intelligence and Robotics at Houston Community College, where I focus on understanding how machine learning models learn from data and how they can support cognitive and behavioral analysis in real contexts. I am especially interested in image-based classification, healthcare applications, and the intersection between psychology and artificial intelligence.

Skills and Technologies

Through the program, I worked with a range of AI and data-science tools that helped me build a solid technical foundation. In particular, I developed experience with:

Python for AI development

TensorFlow and PyTorch for deep learning

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis

Scikit-learn for traditional ML models

Google Colab and Jupyter notebooks

GitHub for version control and portfolio publication

Prompt engineering and visual-language models

Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1, and ROC-AUC

These tools shaped how I approach problem-solving and gave me the confidence to design full AI workflows from dataset preparation to model evaluation.

Courses Completed

Below is an overview of the core courses that structured my training:

ITAI 1378 — Computer Vision for Artificial Intelligence (A I) 

Introduced the foundations of computer vision, including filtering, transformations, segmentation, and early exposure to CNN architectures.# MariaJose-Viveros-AI-Portfolio-ITAI1378

ITAI 2371 — Machine Learning

Introduced supervised and unsupervised learning, model validation, ensemble methods, and interpretability.
