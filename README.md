##Introduction

My name is María José Viveros, and I study Applied Artificial Intelligence and Robotics at Houston Community College. I focus on how machine learning models interpret visual information and how these systems can support cognitive and behavioral analysis, especially in domains connected to psychology and healthcare. Moreover, I am building a portfolio that reflects my learning process, my technical skills, and my commitment to integrating AI with human-centered applications.

##Skills and Technologies

Through the program, I worked with a range of AI and data-science tools that helped me build a solid technical foundation. In particular, I developed experience with:

Python for AI development

TensorFlow and PyTorch for deep learning

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis

Scikit-learn for traditional ML models

Google Colab and Jupyter notebooks

GitHub for version control and portfolio publication

Prompt engineering and visual-language models

Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1, and ROC-AUC

These tools shaped how I approach problem-solving and gave me the confidence to design full AI workflows from dataset preparation to model evaluation.

##Courses Completed

Below is an overview of the core courses that structured my training:

ITAI 1378 — Computer Vision for Artificial Intelligence (A I) 

Introduced the foundations of computer vision, including filtering, transformations, segmentation, and early exposure to CNN architectures.# MariaJose-Viveros-AI-Portfolio-ITAI1378
